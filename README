Stuff.
Stuff I use, which I continue to update 
 * and then have to recreate on another box
 * or have to copy from the work box
 * or all sorts of similar loss of time/debugging.

DMG's fonts are here also ( http://www.trueschool.se )

my "randterm" and "amigaterm2" term scripts (urxvt) +
a few other term launches (awesome menu/keylaunch)

zshrc bits...

and as I add stuff I may comment...
