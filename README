Stuff.
Stuff I use, which I continue to update 
 * and then have to recreate on another box
 * or have to copy from the work box
 * or all sorts of similar loss of time/debugging.

DMG's fonts are here also ( http://www.trueschool.se ) - Powerline versions are just patched versions of these.

my "randterm" and "amigaterm2" term scripts (urxvt) + a few other term launches (awesome menu/keylaunch)

zshrc bits... now with zgen! \o/

- this generally gets put in ~/bin/ - some bits (like zshrc) needs to be moved to ~ . Fonts to .fonts obviously.

and as I add stuff I may comment...
