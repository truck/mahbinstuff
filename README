Stuff.
Stuff I use, which I continue to update 
 * and then have to recreate on another box
 * or have to copy from the work box
 * or all sorts of similar loss of time/debugging.

DMG's fonts are here also ( http://www.trueschool.se )

my "randterm" and "amigaterm2" term scripts (urxvt)

my awesome configstuffs (nothing huge, 3 edits or so)

and as I add stuff I may comment...
